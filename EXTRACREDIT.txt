you can not grow the stack in to the heap because you are only allowed to allocate memory if the
memory is free to use. allocuvm checks if there is memory to grow to and if there is no memory available then
it will throw an exception not allowing for memory allocation. Thus you are not allowed the stack in to the heap 
for this reasoing
